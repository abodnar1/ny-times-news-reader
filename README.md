## Summary
The NY Times News Reader application was built for a take-home challenge where articles were fetched from the [New York Times Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). The application was built in about 8 hours and achieves 100% accessibility.

2. Clone it down to your machine
3. `cd` into the root of the project directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`


## Roadmap
Future features could include:
* Update styling on the Article Details page to be responsive on all screen sizes.
* Add a back button from the Article Details page so user can navigate from the app and not just through the browser.
* Test user stories using Cypress
* Utilize local storage so Article Details can be viewed on page load.
